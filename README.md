# JavaScript30

This repository is created to keep track of my progress and the things I learn in the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge by @Wesbos

## LOGS

### Day 1 -  JavaScript Drum Kit

 I learned: 
- You can choose to the name of your attribute of an HTML tag by adding data in front of it. Ex: data-key, data-item.
- A kbd element is an element that represents user input
- Transitionend is an event listener.

### Day 2

### Day 3 - Playing with CSS Variables and JS

Learned:
- Never knew you could use variables in plain CSS without implementing SASS.
- Have never worked with input type: range before.
- Using :root in CSS lets you add variables accessible in the document object.
- Document.querySelectorAll doesn't provide an array, but rather a nodelist of items that doesn't include prototype methods built in to an Array.
- First time worked with mouse move event listener
- grabbing dataset property from a DOM node returns you an object that includes any values you set with the prefix data-.
- Use document.documentElement.style.setProperty("name of input", "value here") to change variable value

### Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1

Learned:
- Nothing new learned, mostly just reinforced knowledge of Array methods.

### Day 5 - Flex Panels

Learned:
- .querySelectorAll doesnt return an array but a nodelist that doesn't include the mothods on the Array prototype.
- Used event.propertyName property to target which event is being triggered.
- first time using transitionend event.

### Day 6 - Type Ahead

Learned:
- You can easily create a new array with a list of data by using push method and the spread operator.
- Create a new regex object and pass in the parameter of the "word to match" in order to match the value of the input element is how you can identify what is being typed by the user. 
- the 'this' keyword in a function thats passed as an event listener to an element, is the element the event is being triggered on.
- More template literal usage while including expressions gave me insight on how I could make things look a little better when coding in JS

### Day 7 - Array Cardio Day 2

Learned:
- Re-inforced usage of every(), some(), find(), and findIndex() methods and some usages for them.
