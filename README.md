This repository is created to keep track of my progress and the things I learn in the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge by @Wesbos

## LOGS

### Day 1 -  JavaScript Drum Kit

 I learned: 
- You can choose to the name of your attribute of an HTML tag by adding data in front of it. Ex: data-key, data-item.
- A kbd element is an element that represents user input
- Transitionend is an event listener.

### Day 2

### Day 3 - Playing with CSS Variables and JS

Learned:
- Never knew you could use variables in plain CSS without implementing SASS.
- Have never worked with input type: range before.
- Using :root in CSS lets you add variables accessible in the document object.
- Document.querySelectorAll doesn't provide an array, but rather a nodelist of items that doesn't include prototype methods built in to an Array.
- First time worked with mouse move event listener
- grabbing dataset property from a DOM node returns you an object that includes any values you set with the prefix data-.
- Use document.documentElement.style.setProperty("name of input", "value here") to change variable value
